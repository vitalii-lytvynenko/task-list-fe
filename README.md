## Project Structure
The project is organized using React components, TypeScript for type safety, and SCSS for styling. The structure is modular, allowing for easy maintenance and scalability.

- Components: Reusable UI components like TodoList, TodoItem etc.
- Styles: Organized SCSS files following the BEM methodology for consistent styling.
- Hooks: Custom hooks for handling API calls.
- Services: Service modules for interacting with the remote API.
## Features

- Edit Todos: Modify existing tasks directly from the UI.
- Delete Todos: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- Remote API Integration: The app saves and retrieves todo items from a remote API, ensuring your data is always up to date.
## Technologies
- React: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- TypeScript: Superset of JavaScript providing type safety and better developer tooling.
- SCSS: CSS preprocessor used for organizing and maintaining styles.
- Fetch: Used for making HTTP requests to the remote API.
## API
